            <h3>WHY EGYPT</h3>
            <h2>Egypt, the cradle of civilisation</h2>
            <p>
              Egypt is known by names such as: “The mother of the world” or
              “Cradle of civilizations”, due to the different civilizations that
              have converged in its territory throughout history, from the
              different pharaonic dynasties to the times of greatest splendor of
              the Islam, all of them have left the country a heritage that
              deserves the attention of all humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The country has gained international fame as the magical land of
              the pharaohs and pyramids. The Arab Republic of Egypt is a country
              located on two continents: Africa and Asia, because it includes
              the Sinai Peninsula, which belongs to the Asian region of the Near
              East.

                <h4>The Great Pyramids</h4>

                <p>
                  Built around 2600 BC over a span of about 27 years, the
                  pyramid stands as the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the
                  Ancient World. Remarkably, it is the only wonder that has
                  remained largely intact through the ages, showcasing the
                  architectural prowess and enduring legacy of the ancient
                  civilization that constructed it.

                <p>
                  The Great Pyramids of Giza are the greatest relics of Ancient
                  Egypt and one of the most iconic man-made wonders on earth.
                  They were built around 4,500 years ago, made to last for
                  eternity to guide the divine Pharaohs into the afterlife.
                  Today, they show off an astonishing wealth of mathematical and
                  construction genius.

                <h4>Abu Simbel Temple</h4>

                <p>
                  Abu Simbel is an ancient temple complex, originally cut into a
                  solid rock cliff, in southern Egypt and located at the second
                  cataract of the Nile River. The two temples which comprise the
                  site were created during the reign of Ramesses II (c. 1279 -
                  c. 1213 BCE) either between 1264 - 1244 BCE or 1244-1224 BCE.

                <p>Aswan Governorate, Egypt</p>
                <h5>Why to visit</h5>
                <p>
                  The Abu Simbel temple was built for worshiping Pharaoh Ramses
                  II as a god after his death and to display power to the
                  recently conquered territory of Nubia. Notably, the temple
                  features four colossal statues of Ramses II on its facade,
                  each impressively carved to demonstrate the grandeur and might
                  of his reign. This temple stands as a testament to his legacy.

                <h4>Hurghada</h4>

                <p>
                  Hurghada, a coastal city and the capital of Egypt's Red Sea
                  Governorate, has evolved from a small fishing village into one
                  of the largest resort destinations along the Red Sea coast,
                  spanning nearly 40 km. This transformation has made it a key
                  hub for tourism and economic activity in the region.

                <p>
                  Hurghada boasts beautiful beaches and crystal-clear waters
                  ideal for diving and snorkeling. Like Sharm El Sheikh,
                  Hurghada was a tiny fishing village before Egypt's tourism
                  boom in the 1980s. Today, it is a major tourist destination,
                  attracting visitors from around the world to its stunning
                  coastal landscapes and vibrant underwater life.
