            <h3>WHY EGYPT</h3>
            <h2>Egypt, the cradle of civilisation</h2>
            <p>
              Egypt is known by names such as: “The mother of the world” or
              “Cradle of civilizations”, due to the different civilizations that
              have converged in its territory throughout history, from the
              different pharaonic dynasties to the times of greatest splendor of
              the Islam, all of them have left the country a heritage that
              deserves the attention of all humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The country has gained international fame as the magical land of
              the pharaohs and pyramids. The Arab Republic of Egypt is a country
              located on two continents: Africa and Asia, because it includes
              the Sinai Peninsula, which belongs to the Asian region of the Near
              East.

                <h4>The Great Pyramids</h4>

                <p>
                  Built c. 2600 BC, over a period of about 27 years, the pyramid
                  is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and
                  the only wonder that has remained largely intact.

                <p>
                  The Great Pyramids of Giza are the greatest relics of Ancient
                  Egypt and one of the most iconic man-made wonders on earth.
                  They were built around 4,500 years ago, made to last for
                  eternity to guide the divine Pharaohs into the afterlife.
                  Today, they show off an astonishing wealth of mathematical and
                  construction genius.

                <h4>Abu Simbel Temple</h4>

                <p>
                  Abu Simbel is an ancient temple complex, originally cut into a
                  solid rock cliff, in southern Egypt and located at the second
                  cataract of the Nile River. The two temples which comprise the
                  site were created during the reign of Ramesses II (c. 1279 -
                  c. 1213 BCE) either between 1264 - 1244 BCE or 1244-1224 BCE.

                <h5>Why to visit</h5>
                <p>
                  The Abu Simbel temple was constructed as a place for people to
                  worship Pharaoh Ramses II as a god following his death, as
                  well as to be a show of power toward the recently conquered
                  territory of Nubia. The most notable feature of the Abu Simbel
                  temple are the four colossal statues of Ramses II on the
                  outside.
